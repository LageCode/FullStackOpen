## Personal Notes  

- Part0:  
  - Vite: By default, `index.html` does not contain HTML markup visible by human.  
  - JS: ES6 introduced the arrow functions `const arrow = () => {}`.  
- Part1:  
  - JSX: Any JS code in curly brace in evaluated.  
  - JSX: Always render a root element.  
  - JS: The `reduce()` method executes a reducer function for array element, and it returns a single value: the function's accumulated result.
